                <p>Back then, CTS Bank was just a small office with a handful of eager faces, determined to make a difference. We faced tough times
                    economic ups and downs, rules and regulations that seemed to change every day. But we never lost sight of our goal: to help 
                    folks make the most of their money and their lives. As the years went by, CTS Bank grew, opening branches across the country. 
                    But no matter how big we got, we never forgot where they came from. We at CTS Bank still believe in sitting down with folks, getting to know them, 
                    and figuring out how to help.Now, over 40 years later, CTS Bank is still going strong. Times have changed, yet our mission remains the same: to be more 
                    than just a bank, but a trusted friend and partner in every customer's journey to financial freedom. </p>
